- **[Go Type Assertions, Reflection & Boundary Patterns](go-type-assertions-reflection-boundaries.md)**: Deep dive into Go's type system - type assertions vs reflection, nominal typing, circular import solutions, and architectural patterns for handling type boundaries in a multi-exchange trading system. Python developer perspective on mental model shifts.
- **[Go Interfaces and Generics](go-interfaces-and-generics.md)**: Understanding Go's interface semantics (implicit implementation, empty interface internals), generics system (type parameters, constraints, GCShape stenciling), and when to use each type abstraction approach. Complements earlier type assertion learnings.
- **[Go Composition and Embedding](go-composition-and-embedding.md)**: Go's composition-over-inheritance approach - embedding as automatic delegation, field/method promotion, collision handling, and why composition provides better flexibility than traditional inheritance hierarchies.
