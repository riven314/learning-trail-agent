- **[Go Type Assertions, Reflection & Boundary Patterns](go-type-assertions-reflection-boundaries.md)**: Deep dive into Go's type system - type assertions vs reflection, nominal typing, circular import solutions, and architectural patterns for handling type boundaries in a multi-exchange trading system. Python developer perspective on mental model shifts.
- **[Go Interfaces and Generics](go-interfaces-and-generics.md)**: Understanding Go's interface semantics (implicit implementation, empty interface internals), generics system (type parameters, constraints, GCShape stenciling), and when to use each type abstraction approach. Complements earlier type assertion learnings.
- **[Go Composition and Embedding](go-composition-and-embedding.md)**: Go's composition-over-inheritance approach - embedding as automatic delegation, field/method promotion, collision handling, and why composition provides better flexibility than traditional inheritance hierarchies.
- **[Canvas Data Extraction](canvas-data-extraction.md)**: Core mental model of SVG vs Canvas rendering, understanding canvas as bitmap buffer not vector store, intercepting draw calls to capture data before it's discarded, and DevTools injection techniques for hooking canvas methods.
